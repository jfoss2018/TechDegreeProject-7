The recommended structure for your JSON is to create an object literal that
contains a single property called projects. The value of projects is an array
containing an object for each project you wish to include in your portfolio.

Each project object should contain the following properties:
id - give each project a unique id, which can just be a single digit number
  starting at 0 for the first project, 1 for the second project, etc.
project_name
description
technologies - an array of strings containing a list of the technologies used
  in the project
live_link - link to the live version of the project
github_link - link to the GitHub repo
image_urls - an array of strings containing file paths from the views folder to
  the images themselves. You'll need a main image to be shown on the landing
  page, and three images to be shown on the project page.
Note: Feel free to add extra projects to this portfolio if you have them to
  show off.
